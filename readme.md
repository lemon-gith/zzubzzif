Fizzbuzz reverse engineering program.\
Inspired by a coursework set by Imperial's Business School.

## Fizzbuzz Problem

This uses a slightly updated [classic fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz), but with characters/letters instead of fizz and buzz.

But the challenge is that you're only given the output and have to figure out the input values, with the handicap of the `None` outputs having been removed, too D:


## Context

The exact solution came to me while I was working on rewriting my [Python RPG](https://github.com/lemon-gith/pyrpg_2018), while I was thinking about how I could incorporate the fizzbuzz program I'd written into the game, and I remembered that during my previous analysis of this problem, I'd effectively simplified fizzbuzz into a sum of different frequency sine waves.
