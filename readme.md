## Context

The exact solution came to me while I was working on rewriting my [Python RPG](https://github.com/lemon-gith/pyrpg_2018), while I was thinking about how I could incorporate the fizzbuzz program I'd written into the game, and I remembered that during my previous analysis of this problem, I'd effectively simplified fizzbuzz into a sum of different frequency sine waves.
